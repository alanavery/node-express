### Node Express

## Set Up Your Program

1. Create a new repo, `node-express`, and clone it to your local computer.

2. Initialize Node inside of the `node-express` directory.

```
npm init
```

3. Answer the setup prompts. If you want to move forward with a default setting, simply hit `return`.

4. If the initialization was successful, you will see the addition of `package.json` within the `node-express` directory.

5. Create an entry point file named `index.js`.

```
touch index.js
```

6. Run your program.

```
node index.js
```

## Test Drive Your Program

1. Inside `index.js`, add an expression that logs a message to the console.

```js
console.log('Howdy! Alan here.');
```

2. Save the file and run your program. Your message should appear in the terminal.

```
node index.js
Howdy! Alan here.
```

<!-- ## Add a Test Module

1. Create a file named `my-module.js`.

```
touch my-module.js
```

2. Inside the file, add another expression that logs a message to the console. -->
